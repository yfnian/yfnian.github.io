My primary focus lies in unraveling the intricate connections between food systems, food policy, and human decision-making processes that underpin agricultural sustainability concerns. My research covers both consumption and production sides of agricultural systems. In the past, I have conducted studies to understand consumer preferences for eco-labeled food products, the issue of food waste among consumers, and the challenges associated with sustainable technology adoption for producers. My work has been published on peer-reviewed journals such as Agribusiness: An International Journal, Applied Economics, Ecological Economics, HortTechnology, and Water Resources Research.\nI have also had privilege of collaborating with researchers from other fields to engage in outreach efforts. In this capacity, I develop economic decision support tools and assess the economic viability of implementing sustainable agricultural production technologies and practices within farm operations. My work has resulted in a few university‚Äôs extension publications and presentations.
