My current research agenda has been broadly focused on using behavioral economic theories and experimental economic and applied econometric methods to analyze interconnections among food systems, food policy, and human decision-making related to agriculture sustainability issues. My research covers both consumption and production sides of agricultural systems. My work has been published on peer-reviewed journals such as Agribusiness: An International Journal, Applied Economics, Ecological Economics, HortTechnology, and Water Resources Research.\nI have also been fortunate to work in interdisciplinary research teams to conduct outreach works. Specifically, I develop economic decision support tools and analyze the economic feasibility of using sustainable agricultural production technologies and practices in farm operations. My work has resulted in a few universityâ€™s extension publications and extension presentations.
